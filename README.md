Whether you're working with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics data, ATOMIC provides a suite of powerful tools to streamline your analytical workflows.

# Features
Data Integration: Combine multiple omics datasets for comprehensive analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Perform differential expression, pathway enrichment, and other statistical analyses.
Visualization: Generate high-quality plots and visualizations to interpret your results.
Machine Learning: Apply machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and classification tasks.

Installation
To install ATOMIC from GitHub, you'll need to use the remotes package. If you haven't already installed remotes, you can do so by running:

```R

install.packages("remotes")
#Once you have remotes installed, you can install ATOMIC by running the following command:

remotes::install_github("sb-genome/ATOMIC")
```
# Usage
Here's a quick example to get you started with using ATOMIC:

```R
# Load the ATOMIC package
library(ATOMIC)

# Load the dependances for the genre of functions that would be used.
g_initialize(c("Gtex_Summary" , "Haploreg")));
# g_initialize( c("Gtex_Summary", "1000GP_LD_Summary", "Gtex_LD_Summary" , "UKBB_BP_Enrichment" , "Haploreg" , "Genomic_Regions" ));

# Perform Gtex Summary Analysis
GTEx_Summary(SNP = "chr3_49773614_G_A_b38", Gene="ENSG00000182179.12", Tissue="Whole_Blood");

# Perform Haploreg Data Mining
snpToInfo(rsids = "rs10")
snpToInfo(rsids = c("rs10","rs3","rs4","rs10047249"))

# Close the connection to the Servers
g_free(connec)
```
